## Development

This is a Vue.js Single Page App with a simple routing and a custom mechanism for storage. It is (mostly) a thin layer on top of J-Novel Club API (`api.j-novel.club/api`) that is used to provide information into the official mobile app as well as their web reader.

To run this project locally, all you need is any server that can server static assets (e.g. [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)).
Clone this repo, open it in your static file server and you're ready!
